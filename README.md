# Zeroth Responder

911 Call centres get overwhelmed during natural disasters â€“ potentially lifesaving resources are not allocated to the most urgent emergencies. **Zeroth Responder** is a step before _first responders_, using AI to perform triage on emergency calls to categorize their urgency before aggregating all incoming calls to dispatchers. Built using a vector database indexing a real 911 training manual in conjunction with LLMs to perform RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generations).

Built during CalHacks 10.0, received MilvusDB Honourable mention.
